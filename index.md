## CPSC 120

Lab 1, Part 1 
This lab was the introduction to the course so it helped build a good base for the course. 
The introduction to cout and that was a statement that was constantly used throughout this course and was a great way to introduce this concept. I liked the simplicity of the lab
and how it was very small but a very good stepping stone.

Lab 5, Part 2
This lab was one that stood out to me because this is where I felt challenged but was very informational at the same time. Learning conversions
in this lab helped for future labs as it used if functions too. I liked the instructions for this lab as it felt that these were more clear than
previous and future labs.

Lab 7, Part 2
This lab was also one that stood out just because it had instructions that we had to interpret and then write code using if else statements that 
were a little complex at the time. I think this was a very good lab and liked how many components were used to factor into the if statements we 
were to build.
