## CPSC 120

Lab 1, Part 1 
This lab was the introduction to the course so it helped build a good base for the course. 
The introduction to cout and that was a statement that was constantly used throughout this course and was a great way to introduce this concept.

Lab 5, part 2
This lab was one that stood out to me because this is where I felt challenged but was very informational at the same time. Learning conversions
in this lab helped for future labs as it used if functions too.
